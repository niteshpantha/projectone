		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Vegetables are an essential part of a healthy low-carb diet, but sometimes we’re stuck with decisions we might regret later. Some vegetables are high in sugar and don’t cut it nutritionally – so we need to weed them out. Make sure to be careful when eating vegetables as their carb counts do add up quickly.</p>
